#READ ME FOR PRINT.PY FILE

Simple Print: This code just prints out "hello" and "world" on separate lines. It's like typing words on a computer screen.
Using `end` Keyword: Here, it prints "hello" and "world" on the same line, with a "-" between them. It's a bit like writing two words without a space between them.
Printing Different Datatypes Separated by Commas: This line prints out various things like words, numbers, and even True or False. It just lists them with spaces between them.
Using `sep` Keyword: Similar to the previous line, but here, it separates the items with a "/". It's like listing things but using a "/" instead of a space.
Type Casting: This part changes the way numbers or words are seen by the computer. Like turning a number into a word, or a word into a number.
Assigning Values to Multiple Variables in One Line: It's like giving names to different things all at once. For example, calling an apple, a banana, and an orange by their names in one go.
One Value to Multiple Variables: This line gives the same value to many things at once. Like giving everyone in a room the same piece of candy.
