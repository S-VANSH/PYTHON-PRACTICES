#READ ME FOR PRINT.PY FILE

Simple Print: This code just prints out "hello" and "world" on separate lines. It's like typing words on a computer screen.
Using `end` Keyword: Here, it prints "hello" and "world" on the same line, with a "-" between them. It's a bit like writing two words without a space between them.
Printing Different Datatypes Separated by Commas: This line prints out various things like words, numbers, and even True or False. It just lists them with spaces between them.
Using `sep` Keyword: Similar to the previous line, but here, it separates the items with a "/". It's like listing things but using a "/" instead of a space.
Type Casting: This part changes the way numbers or words are seen by the computer. Like turning a number into a word, or a word into a number.
Assigning Values to Multiple Variables in One Line: It's like giving names to different things all at once. For example, calling an apple, a banana, and an orange by their names in one go.
One Value to Multiple Variables: This line gives the same value to many things at once. Like giving everyone in a room the same piece of candy.

#READ ME FOR MODES.py

Setting Initial State: 
   - It starts by setting `current_mode` to "happy" and `grocery_bag` to have chocolate inside it.

Upgrading Mood:
   - It upgrades the mood by adding " and Excited" to the `current_mode` variable.
   - Then, it prints out a message saying how the mood has been upgraded.
   Checking User's Mood:
   - It asks the user if they are feeling happy.
   - If the user's mood isn't "Happy" (capitalization doesn't matter), it asks if they'd like a snack.
   - If there's chocolate in the grocery bag, it says where to find it and hopes the user feels better with another snack.
   - If there's no chocolate in the bag, it informs the user that chocolate is available and wishes them a good day.

#READ ME FOR FUNCTION.py

It asks the user to input two numbers, one after the other.
Then, it adds those two numbers together.
Finally, it prints out the result of the addition.

#READ ME FOR SWAPPING NUMBERS.py

It asks the user to input two numbers, one after the other.
It then temporarily stores the value of the first number (a) in a variable called Temp.
Next, it assigns the value of the second number (b) to a, effectively swapping the values of a and b.
Finally, it assigns the original value of a (which was stored in Temp) to b.
It prints out the new values of a and b.

#READ ME FOR DEF & LIST.py

Creating a New Group:

It defines a function called new_group that was supposed to take in a group name and its members, but inside the function, it sets group_name to "eagles" and members to a tuple containing "sahil", "vansh", and "harshdeep".
Then, it assigns a new tuple ("harsh", "sahil") to new_group, overwriting the function.
Finally, it tries to call new_group as a function, which won't work because it was overwritten by the tuple assignment.

Generating a Band Name:

It defines a function called generate_band_name that asks the user for their city and pet's name, then returns a string combining them to suggest a band name.
It then calls this function, stores the result in band_name, and prints it out.

Working with Lists:

It creates a list called shopping_cart containing various items.
It adds "chilli" to the shopping cart using append().
Then, it removes "banana" from the list using remove().
It prints out the modified shopping cart after each change
